Example : 

$ ./script/generate sammy_crud article

will generate CRUD views (ERB) & the controller for the Article model.

This model and his associated table MUST exist before sammy_crud is executed.

If you prefer Haml, this command is for you :

$ ./script/generate sammy_crud article haml

Enjoy!
